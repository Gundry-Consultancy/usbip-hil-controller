"""Device/hub exclusivity leases.

A lease is a durable claim recorded in `device_leases`:

- `exclusive_device` — a job exclusively owns one DUT. Conflicts with another
  active lease on the same device, or with an `exclusive_hub` lease on its hub.
- `exclusive_hub`    — a job (typically USB-fingerprint learn-mode) owns the
  whole hub, blocking *any* device lease on that hub.

Conflict checks are done inside an IMMEDIATE transaction so two callers cannot
both acquire conflicting leases.
