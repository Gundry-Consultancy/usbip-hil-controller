"""Per-camera control orchestrator.

When devices that share a camera have manual focus or illuminator
brightness overrides, libcamera/the NeoPixel ring need a single
effective value. This module queries those overrides for the devices
currently "active" on each camera (assigned to a running/preparing/
flashing job) and pushes the combined settings to the camera server.

Compromise rules:
  * focus       — midpoint of (min, max) of all manual_focus_dioptres
                  values across active devices. When no device has an
                  override, lens returns to auto.
  * brightness  — max of all illuminator_brightness values across
                  active devices. When no device has a value, brightness
                  goes to 0.

Network failures are swallowed — the camera server is a best-effort
peripheral; a job must never fail because the ring is unreachable.
